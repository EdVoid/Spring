Spring uses Singletons by default, good for Stateless beans

prototype scope produces one bean per request, good for stateful beans

git pull = fetch + merge


default bean id is class name starting with lower case

Section 1.9.2: Autowired

As of Spring Framework 4.3, an @Autowired annotation on such a constructor is no longer necessary if the target bean only defines one constructor to begin with. However, if several constructors are available, at least one must be annotated to teach the container which one to use.

I personally prefer to use the @Autowired annotation because it makes the code more readable. But as mentioned, the @Autowired is not required for this scenario.


Field injection, uses Java Reflection, configure dependency using Autowired annotation, applied directly to the field
no setter me
@Autowired
private FortuneService fortuneService;

NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException
injection will fail if there are multiple bean implementations, use @Qualifire("beanid")

@Qualifier uses bean id, not classname, remember that
